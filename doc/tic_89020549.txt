First object: TIC 89020549, a potentially Saturn-sized planet on a 2 day
orbital period. The evidence for the planet's existence is also attached -- it
could be a blended eclipsing binary, but it's definitely astrophysical.

- is this candidate otherwise interesting?
  - not exceptionally. Tmag=10.8, high PM, and Rp=4.2Re, P=2.1day.

Regardless, this object matches against your Group1604, Star2, star id number
10496. Gaia DR2 entries attached. The relevant numbers for the FML calculation
are all in the attached DR2 crossmatch. By eye, the DR2 RVs make it look like
they're probably comoving: 

RV_1 = -13.41 +/- 0.44 km/s
RV_2 = -19.90 +/- 0.42 km/s
pmRA_1 = 38.177 mas/yr
pmDE_1 = -60.969 mas/yr
pmRA_2 = 35.553 mas/yr
pmDE_2 = -53.055 mas/yr

but if you could check that I'm not obviously wrong, that'd be much
appreciated!

----------

Separation 115 arcmin. Physical separation 6.8pc. Pretty sure this qualifies as
the "large separation" case...

-> might indeed be comoving.

but log-likelihood is ~=6, which is their minimum.
