<1 day Rp=4Re planet. would be WEIRD if real. right in radius desert...
Tmag = 9
USP around 9th mag sunlike star. Signal looks OK but there's a resonance with
30min samples.

Another USP giant candidate. if real, very inflated HJ orbiting a Rstar=2.2Rsun
host

P=0.9 day, Rstar=1.7Rsun, Rp=4.4 Re. weird if real.

P=0.5 day, Rp=13.6Re, Rstar=1.5Rsun candidate. Would be close in!
