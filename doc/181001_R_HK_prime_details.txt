Looking closer at (2), one should note that Lorenzo-Oliviera et al (2018)
recently worked out an age to R_HK' relation for solar twins.

In their Sections 2.3 and 2.4, they describe how to go from HARPS spectra, to
an R_HK' value.

(In fact, they describe two ways).

One of the ways -- using Eqs 7 and 8, once you have the HARPS S indices,
basically do all of the work for you.

Once you've worked out

S_HARPS = 18.349 * (H+K)/(R+V),

then you can transofrm to the Mount Wilson scale:

S_MW = 0.9444 * S_HARPS + 0.0475,

and apply Equations 8 and 3 to get R_HK:

R_HK = 1.34e-4 * C_cf * S_MW,

where C_cf(Teff) is

log C_cf(Teff) = (-1.7e-7) T_eff^2 + (2.25e-3) Teff - 7.31.

Then you compute R_HK' = R_HK - R_phot (subracting away the bolometric flux
from the star, R_HK := F_HK / sigma_SB Teff^4) via:

log R_phot(Teff) = -4.78845 - 3.707 / (1 + (Teff/4587.82)^*17.5272).

Starting with flux(wavelength), we just need to compute H, K, R and V.
Wright et al. 2004, Figure 1 show the channels. They're not so complicated
(thank god).

(from Duncan et al 1991)
Channel R: 3991.07 - 4011.07 angstrom
Channel V: 3891.07 - 3911.07 angstrom.

Two triangular, 1.09 angstrom FWHM bandpasses centered on the H and K lines.

Note that "H, K, R, and V refer to the flux in the corresponding bandpass"
(Wright et al 2004).

You can check the triangles from the plot with WebPlotDigitzer. They are indeed
separated by 4*1.09 angstrom at the base.
