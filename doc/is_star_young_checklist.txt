WHAT IS THE AGE OF MY STAR?

* SIMBAD QUERY. (2' radius)
  Well studied?
  Multiple?
  Skim bibliography -- any history? Any important crossmatches?

* VIZIER QUERY (30" radius, larger for high-PM stars)
  Astrometry? (Gaia DR2, Hipparcos, UCAC5)
  Photometry? (2MASS, WISE)
  Spectral type? (Skiff MK compendium)
  Metallicity? (Fe/H, alpha-rich? LAMOST, APOGEE, RAVE, CKS, Brewer)
  Kinematics (UVW, Vtan)
  Activity indicators (chromospheric activity, e.g., Ca H&K, coronal xray)
  Rotation (P_rot, vsini)

* is it a member of any known groups?
  (clusters & associations OK. "moving groups" be careful.)

* Multiplicity: Washington double star catalog. SB9.

* IR excess? Protoplanetary disk? (<10Myr)

* Any previous age estmiates?

----------

take a LS of the lightcurve...
* is the photometric rotation period comparable to Pleiades/Hyades?
  (Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008)

get a spectra:
* is logR'_HK between -4.4 to -4.7?
* is there Li doublet absorption, at 6707A?
