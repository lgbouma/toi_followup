Second object: TIC 6248327. A possible planet with an 11 day orbital period and
radius = 2.7* earth's. This one is less easy to follow up, but it may be
interesting to do so because of the membership noted below.

Star is HIP 110692, star 3934, group 214, size of group is 3. Star is Star 1 of
the group. The DR2 crossmatch isn't instantly working, but if this is
interesting, I can get them to you! All 3 stars should be bright enough to have
DR2 RVs. If they're a mini-group, assuming they were coeval would help modeling
the candidate system.

----------

From Table 1c of Oh+ 2017, the group's distance is 44.9pc. Indeed this would be
super interesting if it were a young system. I think to confirm it'd be best to
have stellar spectra, so we could model the isochrones. I'm copying in Joel,
who knows a bit more about identifying young stars...

----------

Relevant update: the star hosting the planet candidate here also shows a RAVE
"chromospheric activity excess". I need to learn more about whether this
matters, but it correlates helpfully with age.

Ks mag = 7.7 (from TIC, crossmatched on position)

but Simonian et al argued that short rotation periods might not imply youth--
they might instead imply a tidally synchronized binary. (Here "short" means
Prot < 10 days, for which they see an increasing photometric binary fraction).

Looking at their Fig 1, for a Teff=4500K K dwarf, if M_Ks ~= 4.3, it's on the
single star MS.

If M_Ks ~> 4.0, there's an increasing chance that it's a photometric binary.

recall mu = m - M, for mu the distance modulus, m the apparent mag, and M the
absolute mag.

Gaia parallax for this system gave plx = 23.5527 mas, for distance = 42.5 pc.

No astrometric excess error.

mu = 5 log10(d) - 5
   = 5 log10(42.5) - 5
  ~= 3.14194

thus

M_Ks = m - mu
     = 7.7 - 3.14
     = 3.86

--> it's probably a photometric binary! Note though that this may have messed
up the spectral typing, since it's ~0.4 mags brighter than the main sequence of
their Fig 1.

If Simonian et al's idea of tidal synchronization is a good one, this clearly
raises the probability of this object being wonky for some reason.

GaiaDR2: Teff=4300K, L=0.10Lsun, radius=0.57Rsun
-> from Mamajek's table, consistent with K5V (though slightly small)

--> all three are K dwarfs. A bit odd.

- does ESO archive (HARPS) have anything?
-> yes, see analysis
- does Keck public archive have anything? (dec -35, unlikely)
-> no
