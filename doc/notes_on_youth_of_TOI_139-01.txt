Purpose: inform TFOP members about some interesting properties of TIC 62483237
       = TOI 139.01, relevant for consideration during follow-up and analysis.

------------------------------------------
SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

See SG2, SG4, and ExoFOP TESS notes for details of iSHELL and TRES results.

There are 10 public HARPS RVs.  Phasing them to the TESS ephemeris yields an
OK, but not great keplerian fit. (Points are large when they should be large,
small when they should be small).

Since P_orb ~= 11 days, and P_rotation ~= 8 days, RV signals should be treated
with caution. The data also phase up well with stellar rotation.

The HARPS 1d spectra show very obvious CaII H & K emission.

The TRES spectra (from ExoFOP TESS) do not, however they are in the low-SNR
regime.

They don't show any obvious Li absorption (by eye).

------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS OF YOUTH INDICATORS

At first pass, this object has three independent indicators of youth:

1 Its photometric rotation period is ~8 days (from the TESS lightcurve by
  eye, but also via ACF analysis). With its B-V=1.2, from e.g., Mamajek &
  Hillenbrand 2008, Figure 9, this implies an age commensurate with stars in
  the Pleaides. (If one believes the gyrochronology. One reason not to is if
  binarity affected the rotation period. Given the public HARPS RV amplitudes
  of K~=7m/s, this is unlikely).

2 In RAVE DR4, the star is flagged as showing a chromospheric emission excess
  (Ca H & K). In the 10 public HARPS spectra, you can easily see this emission by
  eye. Stars with large amounts of Ca HK emission tend to be young (e.g.,
  Noyes et al 1984, Wright et al 2004, Lorenzo-Oliviera et al 2018).

  Converting this emission into R_HK' requires calculating S indices, and
  convert to R_HK' using a color or Teff-dependent function that has been
  correctly calibrated. See below for more.

3 Oh et al (2017) report that the host star is in a candidate comoving group
  with a total of three stars. In their nomenclature, the planet-host star is
  HIP 110692, star 3934, group 214. 

----------
Looking closer at (3) shows (private communication from Semyeong Oh) that the
candidate comoving group is not real. This comes from Gaia DR2 radial
velocities, which were not available in Oh+ 2017's original work.  Note that
Semyeong Oh also showed that there are no Gaia DR2 sources nearby this star
that might obviously be comoving.

Thus, there are only two independent indicators of youth: (1) the photometric
rotation period, (2) the strong activity, as represented by Ca HK emission.

Looking by eye in the HARPS spectra for Li absorption, none is immediately
visible. However, for a Teff~=4500 K star, this isn't so surprising (Berger et
al 2018).

----------
Looking closer at (2), one should note that Lorenzo-Oliviera et al (2018)
recently worked out an age to R_HK' relation for solar twins.

They also reported a calibration scheme that extended down to mid K dwarfs.
Following their T_eff-dependent calibration scheme, I wind up getting
R_HK_prime between -4.42 to -4.51 in all the public HARPS spectra. 

This is consistent with a sub-Gyr old, or even sub-500-Myr old star.

----------
The host star is also overluminous, based on Simonian et al (2018)'s Gaia HR
diagram.

Ks mag = 7.7 (from TIC, crossmatched on position)

Looking at Simonian+ 2018's Fig 1, for a Teff=4500K K dwarf, if M_Ks ~= 4.3,
it's on the single star MS.

If M_Ks ~> 4.0, there's an increasing chance that it's a photometric binary.

recall mu = m - M, for mu the distance modulus, m the apparent mag, and M the
absolute mag.  Gaia parallax for this system gave plx = 23.5527 mas, for
distance = 42.5 pc.  (Note: no astrometric excess error in DR2).

mu = 5 log10(d) - 5
  ~= 3.1419

thus

M_Ks = m - mu
     = 7.7 - 3.14
     = 3.86

--> it's probably a photometric binary! It's ~0.4 mags brighter than the main
sequence of Simonian+ 2018's Fig 1.

If Simonian et al's idea of tidal synchronization is a good one, this clearly
raises the probability of this object being wonky for some reason.

However the HARPS RVs rule out a tidally synchronized binary. So this star's
status as a photometric binary should be a word of caution.

----------
Ciardi et al posted their Keck AO images on ExoFOP-TESS.

Assuming d~=40pc, they rule out deltamag < 3 companions down to 0.2 arcsec = 8
AU.

This is somewhat surprising, given the photometric excess discussed above.

----------
Note that using the Teff, logg, [Fe/H] from RAVE DR4, and the parallax from
Gaia DR2, we can run an isochrone fit using the MIST models (Choi et al 2016),
and interpolated by Tim Morton's `isochrones` package.

The resulting age (taking a log-uniform age prior from 10^7 - 10^10.15 years)
is 2 sigma discrepant from being sub-Gyr old.

It would be preferable for such an analysis to fold in the photometry, more
believable stellar parameters, and the stellar density from the transit.

CANDIDATE COMOVING STARS IDENTIFIED BY OH ET AL 2017:

(The group isn't real, given DR2 RVs!! delta RV ~= 10km/s)

Planet host:
HIP 110692, GAIADR2 6598814657249555328, TIC 62483237

Comover 1:
G=10.93, GAIADR2 6609416423242710272, TYC 6970-1089-1, HIP --
separation 480"
http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%407341114&Name=TYC%206970-1089-1&submit=submit
GaiaDR2: Teff=4300K, L=0.10Lsun, radius=0.57Rsun
-> from Mamajek's table, consistent with K5V (though slightly small)

Comover 2:
G=9.2, GAIADR2 6625576838989093632, TYC --, HIP 110695

--> all three are K dwarfs. A bit odd.
