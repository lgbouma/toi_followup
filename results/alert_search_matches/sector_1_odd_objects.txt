Rp=4Re planet
crossmatch against high-PM Oh+2017 candidate comoving pair.
Oh's candidate comoving pair would have d~=6pc. They have it a log likelihood
of "6", about average for their objects.

Next:
* understand Price-Whelan 2017 for how to use instantaneous RVs to confirm
	they're wide-separation binaries
* crossmatch this star against RAVE DR5, like Price-Whelan did.
	-> is it one?

"These pairs are identified by searching for approximately cospatial stars that
appear to be comoving either in sky-projected velocities -- we refer to these as
comoving pair candidates" -- or using full-space velocity information -- we
refer to these as confirmed comoving pairs." Radial velocity follow-up is
still needed to confirm the majority of the known candidates, though Gaia DR2
will provide radial velocities for the brightest stars (G < 12; Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2016b)."

If you had an RV, how would you use it?
"For the remaining 311 pairs, we use the measured radial velocities to
re-compute the marginal likelihood ratio for the two hypotheses considered in
previous work (see Appendix B, Oh et al. 2017)"
"We compute two fully marginalized likelihoods (FMLs)
for the data: (1) assuming that the two stars are comoving with identical 3D
velocity vectors (within some allowed small dispersion), and (2) assuming that
the two stars have independent 3D velocity vectors drawn from a prior velocity
distribution."

ok, well. Gaia DR2 gives the RVs as:
RV_1 = -13.41 +/- 0.44 km/s
RV_2 = -19.90 +/- 0.42 km/s  (this is the matched planet candidate star, follow
      Oh's index scheme)

these seem pretty close.

pmRA_1 = 38.177 mas/yr
pmDE_1 = -60.969 mas/yr

pmRA_2 = 35.553 mas/yr
pmDE_2 = -53.055 mas/yr

dr2_id_1 = 6568766761106637440
dr2_id_2 = 6520880040423258240
